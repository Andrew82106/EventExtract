The driver, a man who soldiers said behaved in a friendly manner, made a phone call to someone in the capital. The driver passed the phone to the soldiers to speak to a well-known man who vouched for the truck and persuaded soldiers to allow it into the city, said the Somali intelligence official. Once through the checkpoint, the truck began to speed along the sandy, potholed road and raced through another checkpoint where soldiers opened fire and flattened one of its tires. A huge explosion from a truck bomb killed almost 200 people in Somalia's capital, police said Saturday, as shaken residents called it the most powerful blast ever witnessed in the city.",
